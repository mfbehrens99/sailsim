# _sailsim_ - A sail boat simulator

This sailboat simulation program is meant to test sailing algorithms. Provide the simulation a sailboat, some wind and a sailing algorithm and the boat will sail in this virtual world.

This is a remake (not rewrite) of [sailsim-python](https://github.com/mfbehrens99/sailsim-python)

Very WIP

## How to run

Install Rust [Official installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfbehrens99/sailsim
cd sailsim
cargo run
```
